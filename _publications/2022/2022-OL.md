  Optical secure key distribution (SKD) based on reciprocity has been the subject of increasing discussion, for its inherent information-theoretic safety and because there is less occupation of fiber channels. The combination of reciprocal polarization and broadband entropy sources has proven effective in increasing the rate of SKD. However, the stabilization of such systems suffers from the limited span of polarization states and inconsistent polarization detection. The specific causes are analyzed in principle. To solve this issue, we propose a strategy for extracting secure keys from orthogonal polarizations. Optical carriers with orthogonal polarizations at interactive parties are modulated by external random signals using polarization division multiplexing dual-parallel Machâ€“Zehnder modulators. After bidirectional transmission through a 10-km fiber channel, error-free SKD with a rate of 2.07 Gbit/s is experimentally realized. The high correlation coefficient of the extracted analog vectors can be maintained for over 30 min. The proposed method is a step toward the development of secure communication with high speed and feasibility.
