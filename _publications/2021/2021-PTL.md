  We experimentally demonstrate a chaotic synchronization scheme based on the electro-optic hybrid entropy sources. The chaos synchronization method is experimentally validated that 200 km high-level chaos synchronization can be attained and the distance can be further extended. The digital signal induced chaos synchronization signal has good robustness against the potential distortions in long-haul optical transmission. On the basis of the digital signal induced chaos synchronization strategy, a correlated random bit generation (CRBG) scheme with bit rate of 1.25 Gb/s and distance of 200 km is proposed. The generated correlated random bit sequences (CRBSs) pass all the NIST tests. Meanwhile, a data encryption scheme based on the robust chaos synchronization method is proposed with low computation complexity. The synchronization signal, in which the encrypted data is embedded, maintains the strength in long-haul transmission. The strong robustness of the scheme under parameter mismatch is numerically analyzed. These propositions show great potential in the field of secure communication, especially the long-haul scenario.
